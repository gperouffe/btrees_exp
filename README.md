# btrees_exp

An experiment on b_trees efficiency with respect to node size  
It uses the C++-BTree STL-like template from Google Open Source (Apache license 2.0)

####Usage:
Compile bt_test.cc  
run bt_test \<maximum node size\> \<nOps\>

####Tests performed:
For each node size, inserts, searches and deletes nOps random keys, prints to stdout in a CSV format the time needed to perform each type of operation.
